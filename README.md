# AFAA Website

This is a small repository to practice our web development so we can later create the final website in which "A Fleet Among Angels" will be played on.

## Purpose
As mentioned above, the purpose of this project is to practice and develop our web development skills using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and their different libraries and tools. 
This will be an Informational Website. It will contain a description of the game, updates on development, and maybe some small easter eggs here and there!


**Updates may include:**

* Sneak Peaks of the game

* Challenges faced during development

* Thought Process and behind the scenes
