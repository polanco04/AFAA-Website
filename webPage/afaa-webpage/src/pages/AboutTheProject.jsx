                <br/>A Fleet Among Angels is a project that wears its inspirations on its sleeves; Franchises such as Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Mobile Suit Gundam, and Fire Emblem all serve as strong references during the creative process for this game. From the setting to the characters to the gameplay mechanics, many aspects of fantastic works aid us during the development of this project.
